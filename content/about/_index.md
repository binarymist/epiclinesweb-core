### 🇳🇿 Our Story: Precision Meets Passion

The _EpicLines_ philosophy is simple: we fuse deep engineering standards with uncompromising dedication to craftsmanship across everything we create. Our two divisions—Motorhome Design and Fabrication and Surf Products—are unified by the founder's unique background and a commitment to quality over convention.

#### The [Founder's](https://purpleteam-labs.com/about/) Unique Journey

Our foundation is built on a diverse career that blends practical building skills with high-tech analytical precision. Born and raised by the beach in Christchurch, New Zealand, the hands-on journey began early. Repairing surfboards since the age of nine and gaining school work experience at Canterbury Wetsuits (now called SeventhWave), which led to a full-time job at the same company. Then on to an apprenticeship in carpentry, followed by various carpentry foreman roles, a carpentry business, providing a strong foundation in practical construction and durable building techniques.

This was followed by 23 years in technology and consultancy, navigating over 35 roles. Beginning as a Software Tester, this career evolved through roles like Software Engineer, Software Architect, and specialised security roles, including penetration testing and Application Security Engineer. This extensive technical history involved deep mastery of low-level engineering and complex architectural design—skills that instilled the analytic rigour now applied to every physical build. This professional expertise is paired with a lifelong connection to the ocean, having surfed since the age of seven.

_EpicLines_ represents the merger of these worlds: building things that last, with a quality that is beautiful in both seen and unseen design, and in every structural detail, crafted by a perfectionist. The launch of the business was driven by the clarity gained after redundancy from GuardRails, an Application Security (AppSec) startup, focusing professional skills toward a lifelong constructive passion.

#### The _EpicLines_ Design Philosophy

If we don't believe a product that we design or make is the best it can possibly be, or if we wouldn't use it ourselves, it is not made available.

This philosophy means:

* We only sell products that we design and/or manufacture, and services that are directly executed or overseen by us for quality.
* Perfectionism: Every detail is executed with a relentless drive for excellence, shaped by the founder’s unique combination of gifted thinking and neurodivergent problem-solving strengths.
* Innovation: Every challenge becomes a chance to rethink and refine — creating solutions that go well beyond conventional expectations.
