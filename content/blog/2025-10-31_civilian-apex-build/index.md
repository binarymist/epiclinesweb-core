A few things you'll notice immediately or eventually:

* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; The care, patience and skill that has gone into this build<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; All exposed steel has been meticulously primed and in many cases received "preventative" rust neutralisation treatment, especially in places that metal filings may have landed after thourough vacuming multiple times<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; Everything is designed light but strong, this takes on average about 3 x as long to build, even down to the tiny metal brackets, we custom cut aluminium brackets instead of buying steel brackets<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; Almost everything is easily accessible. Panels are able to be removed in case you ever need to install additional services<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; Service hatches are provided when there is a chance you may need to get to something conceiled<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; No stone is left unturned<br>

### How did we get here?

Following are the indepth build details for the _EpicLines_ Civilian Apex.

#### Cab Cuts

This video goes through the cab cuts and reinforcement for gas bottle box, toilet. Initial 11kg battery box before replacing it with a revised 3kg (but just as strong) version.
Notice the cardboard on the insides of windows to pretect the glass from any flying sparks which have the tendency to create pitting.
There is weight in this box-section steel, so we reclaim our weight addition in just about every other place possible.

<br>




#### Water Tank Bottoms Being Prepared

7.5mm H3.2 ply, primed and painted both sides.


{{< instagram DA1ltfbpXom >}}
<br>





#### Water Tank Tension Rods Being Lock-Tighted

Notice the meticulous care taken to prime bare steel surfaces. The 3 x 2 H3.2 joists you see were later removed and replaced with aluminium to provide >= strength and about 3 x less weight.

<br>





#### Water Tanks Installed

Food grade 5mm plastic freshwater and greywater tanks.
Notice the vacuum cleaner always on hand to suck up metal filings?
The vehicle exhaust also had to be rerouted.

<br>







#### Gas Bottles Box Going In

The box will house up to two 12kg LPG bottles.


{{< instagram DBXC2JPpA7O >}}
<br>






#### Joinery Going In

Kitchen, Lounge/Digital Workspace Joinery In. Much of which has to yet be removed again to be lightened with a router, which is a tedious job but means you can load-up the Civilian Apex with aproximatly 1500kg before reaching the legal limit (GVM).
Long surfbaords can be slid under the seats both sides.

{{< instagram DBrtWuKpLIn >}}
<br>


#### Cupboard and Drawer Fronts Stylishly Lightened

All of the kitchen cupbaords and draw fronts have had the majority of their MDF cut out and replaced with okoume ply.
Another time consuming job. Once the fronts are cut and fit to the carcass, then they have to have their centers cut out, the backs routed out so that the 4mm ply can sit flush behind the MDF.
Then once all constructed, the 4mm ply is removed. The MDF boarders are sealed with our premium shellac-based sealer which locks the MDF fibres, we then spray the MDF with an enamel.
The okoume ply is then sealed on the back with the same 3 coats of shellac-based sealer, then the top has 5 coats of premium plant-based wax oil ragged on, one coat per day, then we wait 2 weeks for that to cure before we can reassemble the MDF and ply parts.
This makes for beautiful and very light fronts.

#### Aluminium Roof Rails

These rails support the 6 x 325W fill width solar panels, allowing the Maxxfan to open and providing external surfboard storage underneath the solar panels.

#### Pedantic Cleanup of Metal Filings

Talk about how pedantic _EpicLines_ is in the task of removing metal filings.

<br>




#### Beautiful Roof, Let's Look After It!

Final cut and wax before solar panels go on. At epiclines we make sure the parts you don't normally see, are looked after even better than the parts you do see.

<br>



#### Macrocarpa Bench Top Construction

We use 90 x 20 Macrocarpa decking boards, jointed with biscuits and epoxy resined together. Then finished with 5 coats of premium plant-based wax oil ragged on, making the top water proof and stain proof. We use the same oil and process on all timber surfaces that are not painted. It is very time consuming, but looks and feels beautiful when finished, and is very hard wearing.

{{< instagram DFWD3qjzato >}}
<br>




#### Ceiling Cabinet Construction

We use 4mm okoume ply over manually milled 16mm x 16mm specially selected (no knots) framing. It must be light but also strong. Allowing you the owner to have aprx 1500kg of loading capacity in the Civilian Apex.
The okoume ply is 4kg per sheet as opposed to 16mm MDF which is 32kg per sheet. Yes we know how much every part that goes into the build weighs.
The ceiling cabinets must be built in-situ, so cannot be spray painted, but must be rolled. We use 2-3 coats of a premium shellac-based sealer/primer, followed by 3 coats of Resene Spacecoat.
In one of the images you can see the MDF where the oven goes has been lightened by using a router to cut out a large area. This process is appled to most of the joinery in the Civilian Apex.
All screws are removed once the glue has cured.

#### Oven With Hob In Place

This oven is a DometicMC101. The reasons we chose this unit over others:

* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; It was the only gas oven with fan bake that we could find<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; As well as 3 x gas hobs, it has one hob that is 240v, so if you run out of LPG you can still use the stove top. There is of course the multi-function microwave with built in air fryer and grill as well<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; This is no ordinary cook top, the gas hobs are amazing on this unit, you'll love them<br>

<br>



#### Striping the Bumpers and Repainting

This unit arrived with vinyl wrap on both bumpers and quarter the way up the panels on each side of the bus.
To remove the ugly vinyl and restore all panels and bumpers to their former glory took about 6 weeks work.
After the Caramel wheel has removed the vinyl on the bumpers, we used 80g - 120g - 240g - 320g - 400g - 600g wet sand paper on the bumpers.
We then apply a 20% IsoPropal to 80% water mix to remove any contaminants left on the surface.
The Bumpers are then spray painted with 3 coats of a special purpose plastic etching primer, followed with 3 top coats of a special purpose bumper paint.

#### Battery and Box

The battery is a 60kg 24V 280AH (equivalant capacity to 12V 560AH) Lithium Battery so the box needs to be very strong, but also needs to be light.
We use 4mm okoume ply with 25mm H3.2 timber framing and aluminium brackets at intersections. All well primed and painted with our usual 3 x coats of shellac-based sealer and 3+ coats of Resene Spacecoat.
All timber surfaces are well glued (stronger than screws) and screwed.
The box is bolted in place with 5 x 8mm galvanised bolts and square washes to spread the load on 4 x double layerd okoume play patches to increase strength where it's needed without adding weight where it's not needed.
We strength test the box by loading it up with 3 x the weight of the battery, then performing mid-air drop tests.

  class="ma0 w-75"
>}}

As an added safety measure we strap the box up with galvanised and painted steel strapping to the chassis, with aluminium corners to spread the weight along the edges of the box.
The result is a very strong and durable box that is also very light, weighing in at 3kg.

#### Main Ceilings

Ceilings are 4mm okoume ply. This is what the process looks like:

1. Measure and create 3mm thinline patterns and fix them to the ceiling framing
2. Remove the thinline and make any required minor adjustments to the edges because they have to be perfect because there is 4mm negative margins at all sheet joins. Anything less than perfect is visually obvious
3. Cut the okoume ply, mark penetrations and fixing pints, and finally fix the okoume ply sheets to the ceiling framing
4. Remove the okoume ply sheets, paint all negative margin recesses with black
5. lightly sand both front and back with 400g sandpaper. Apply 2+ coats of our premium shellac-based sealer/primer to the backs of the sheets to help with condensation. The okoume is a durable timber anyway so no issue with rot. Apply 5 coats (ragged on) of our premium plant based wax oil. Leave 24 hours between each coat. Then leave to cure for 2 weeks minimum
6. Refix the finished okoume ply sheets to the ceiling framing
7. Admire how good it looks

#### 4kW, 24V DC Diesel Heater Install

Aproximatly 1 weeks work.

Similarly to the ceilings, everything has to be built in-situ, then removed, prepared and painted.
The heater has to be mounted to a raised box in order for it's exhaust to bypass sub-floor framing with adaquite space. The exhaust can not be touching anything because it gets very hot. Even the raised box is lightened by routing out unnecessary weight.
We install a 15L fuel tank which provides diesel to last a very long time.
We also wrap near by pipes with reflective heat insulation.
After the heater is installed, we build the wardrobe and microwave cabinet around it. All of which can be removed if the diesel heater ever has to be serviced.
