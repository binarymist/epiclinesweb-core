A few things you'll notice immediately, or eventually:

* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; The care, patience and skill that has gone into this build<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; All exposed steel has been meticulously primed and in many cases received "preventative" rust neutralisation treatment, especially in places that metal filings may have landed after thorough vacuuming multiple times<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; Everything is designed light but strong, this takes an average of about 3 times as long to build, even down to the tiny metal brackets, we custom cut aluminium brackets instead of buying steel brackets<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; Almost everything is easily accessible. Panels can be removed in case you ever need to install additional services<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; Service hatches are provided when there is a chance you may need to get to something concealed<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; No stone is left unturned<br>

### What Did The Build Process Look Like?

The following are the in-depth build details for the _EpicLines_ Civilian Apex.

<br>

#### Cab Cuts

</a></p>

This video goes through the cab cuts and structural reinforcement for the 2 x LPG gas bottle box and toilet. Initial 11kg battery box before replacing it with a revised 3kg (but just as strong) version.
Notice the cardboard on the insides of windows to protect the glass from any flying sparks, which tend to create pitting.<br>
There is weight in this box-section steel, so we offset that weight by reclaiming it in just about every other place possible.

<br>

#### Plumbing Waste Details

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_6bnf8plTl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <i class="tf-ion-social-instagram-outline"></i> Instagram Reel
</a></p>

This video goes through the 40mm uPVC waste pipe install, water tanks, and water pump box.

<br>

#### Making of Water Tank Cradles

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_-To79SrCk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

Construction images.

<br>

#### Water Tank Bottoms Being Prepared

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DA1ltfbpXom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <i class="tf-ion-social-instagram-outline"></i> Instagram Reel
</a></p>

7.5mm H3.2 ply, primed and painted both sides.

<br>

#### Water Tank Tension Rods Being Lock-Tighted

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBFOQonJ7mC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <i class="tf-ion-social-instagram-outline"></i> Instagram Reel
</a></p>

Notice the meticulous care taken to prime bare steel surfaces. The 3 x 2 H3.2 joists you see were later removed and replaced with aluminium to provide >= strength and about 3 x less weight.

<br>

#### Water Tanks Installed

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAmcKSsSXXx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <i class="tf-ion-social-instagram-outline"></i> Instagram Post
</a></p>

5mm Food-grade plastic freshwater and greywater tanks.
Notice the vacuum cleaner is always on hand to suck up metal filings?
The vehicle exhaust also had to be rerouted.

<br>

#### Meticulous Care Taken with Bare Steel

</a></p>

H3.2 framing with welded brackets, and of course, all exposed steel surfaces primed.

<br>

#### Framing for Gas Bottles Box

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBZfQLWp5Iu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

Timber Framing comes out again, then exposed steel gets painted.

<br>

#### Gas Bottles Box Going In

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBXC2JPpA7O/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <i class="tf-ion-social-instagram-outline"></i> Instagram Reel
</a></p>

The box will house up to 2 x 12kg LPG bottles.

<br>

#### Joinery Going In

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBrtWuKpLIn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

</a></p>

Kitchen, Lounge/Digital Workspace Joinery In. Much of which has to be yet removed again to be lightened with a router, which is a tedious job but means you can load up the Civilian Apex with approximately 1500kg before reaching the legal limit (GVM).
Long surfboards can be slid under the seats on both sides.

<br>

#### Cupboard and Drawer Fronts Stylishly Lightened

All of the kitchen cupboards and drawer fronts have had the majority of their MDF cut out and replaced with okoume ply.
Another time-consuming job. Once the fronts are cut and fit to the carcass, then they have to have their centres cut out, the backs routed out so that the 4mm ply can sit flush behind the MDF.
Then, once all are constructed, the 4mm ply is removed. The MDF borders are sealed with our premium shellac-based sealer, which locks the MDF fibres. We then spray the MDF with an enamel.
The okoume ply is then sealed on the back with the same 3 coats of shellac-based sealer, then the top has 5 coats of premium plant-based wax oil ragged on, one coat per day, then we wait 2 weeks for that to cure before we can reassemble the MDF and ply parts.
This creates beautiful and very light fronts.

<br>

#### Aluminium Roof Rails

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDVKSv6Tj_-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <i class="tf-ion-social-instagram-outline"></i> Instagram Post
</a></p>

These rails support the 6 x 325W full-width solar panels, allowing the Maxxfan Delux to open and providing external surfboard storage underneath the solar panels.

<br>

#### Pedantic Cleanup of Metal Filings

#### Beautiful Roof, Let's Look After It!

</a></p>

Final cut and wax before solar panels go on. At _Epiclines_, we make sure the parts you don't normally see are looked after even better than the parts you do see.

<br>

#### Macrocarpa Bench Top Construction

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFWD3qjzato/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <i class="tf-ion-social-instagram-outline"></i> Instagram Post
</a></p>

We use 90 x 20 Macrocarpa decking boards, jointed with biscuits and epoxy resined together. Then finished with 5 coats of premium plant-based wax oil ragged on, making the top waterproof, stain-proof, very hard wearing, and looks and feels beautiful when finished. We use the same oil and process on all timber surfaces that are not painted. This is a very time-consuming process, but well worth it.

Once the bench tops are constructed and fitted, they are then removed, and 5 coats of our premium plant-based wax oil are ragged on, 24 hours between each coat. Then left to cure for 2 weeks minimum, then reinstalled.

<div>{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/sink-bench_min.jpg" alt="Sink Bench" class="" >}}</div><br>

#### Ceiling Cabinet Construction

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFWEEPfzST7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <i class="tf-ion-social-instagram-outline"></i> Instagram Post
</a></p>

We use 4mm okoume ply over manually milled 16mm x 16mm, specially selected (no knots) framing. It must be light but also strong. Allowing you, the owner, to have approximately 1500kg of loading capacity in the Civilian Apex.
The okoume ply is 4kg per sheet as opposed to 16mm MDF, which is 32kg per sheet. We know how much every part that goes into the build weighs.
The ceiling cabinets must be built in-situ, so they cannot be spray-painted, but must be rolled. We use 2-3 coats of a premium shellac-based sealer/primer, followed by 3 coats of Resene Spacecoat.
In one of the images, you can see that the MDF where the oven goes has been lightened by using a router to cut out a large area. This process is applied to most of the joinery in the Civilian Apex.
All screws are removed once the glue has cured.

<br>

#### Oven With Hob In Place

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFWELCiTYlC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <i class="tf-ion-social-instagram-outline"></i> Instagram Post
</a></p>

This oven is a Dometic MC101. The reasons we choose this unit over others:

* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; It is the only gas oven on the market with fan bake<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; As well as 3 x gas hobs, it has one hob that is 240v, so if you run out of LPG you can still use the stove top. There is, of course, the multi-function microwave with built-in air fryer and grill as well<br>
* <i class='tf-ion-android-bus'></i> &nbsp; This is no ordinary cook top, the gas hobs are amazing on this unit, you'll love them<br>

<br>

#### Striping the Bumpers and Repainting

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIaMw40yy2W/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <i class="tf-ion-social-instagram-outline"></i> Instagram Post
</a></p>

This unit arrived with vinyl wrap on both bumpers and the quarter way up the panels on each side of the bus.
To remove the ugly vinyl and restore all panels and bumpers to their former glory took about 6 weeks of work.
After the Caramel wheel has removed the vinyl on the bumpers, we used 80g, 120g, 240g, 320g, 400g, and 600g wet sandpaper on the bumpers.
We then apply a 20% IsoPropal to an 80% water mix to remove any contaminants left on the surface.
The Bumpers are then spray-painted with 3 coats of a special-purpose plastic etching primer, followed by 3 top coats of a special-purpose bumper paint.

<br>

#### Battery and Box

The battery is a 60kg 24V 280AH (equivalent capacity to 12V 560AH) Lithium Battery, so the box needs to be very strong, but also needs to be light.
We use 4mm okoume ply with specially selected (no knots) 25mm H3.2 timber framing and aluminium brackets at intersections. All well primed and painted with our usual 3 x coats of shellac-based sealer and 3+ coats of Resene Spacecoat.
All timber surfaces are well glued (stronger than screws) and screwed.
The box is bolted in place with 5 x 8mm galvanised bolts and square washers to spread the load on 4 x double-layered okoume play patches to increase strength where it's needed without adding weight where it's not needed.
We strength test the box by loading it up with 3 x the weight of the battery, then performing mid-air drop tests.

{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/battery-box_min.jpg" alt="battery and box" class="" >}}

As an added safety measure, we strap the box up with galvanised and painted steel strapping to the chassis, with aluminium corners to spread the weight along the edges of the box.
The result is a very strong and durable box that is also very light, weighing in at 3kg.

<div>{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/under-battery-box_min.jpg" alt="battery and box" class="" >}}</div>
<br>

#### Main Ceilings

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIaOHQFyAj_/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <i class="tf-ion-social-instagram-outline"></i> Instagram Post
</a></p>

Ceilings are 4mm okoume ply. This is what the process looks like:

1. Measure and create 3mm thinline patterns and fix them to the ceiling framing
2. Remove the thinline and make any required minor adjustments to the edges because they have to be perfect, because there are 4mm negative margins at all sheet joins. Anything less than perfect is visually obvious
3. Mark and cut the okoume ply from the thinline pattern and adjustments, mark penetrations and fixing points, and finally fix the okoume ply sheets to the ceiling framing
4. Remove the okoume ply sheets, paint all negative margin recesses with black
5. Lightly sand both front and back with 240g sandpaper. Apply 2+ coats of our premium shellac-based sealer/primer to the backs of the sheets to help with condensation. The okoume is a durable timber anyway, so no issue with rot. Apply 5 coats (ragged on) of our premium plant-based wax oil. Leave 24 hours between each coat. Then leave to cure for 2 weeks minimum
6. Refix the finished okoume ply sheets to the ceiling framing
7. Admire how good it looks

#### 4kW, 24V DC Diesel Heater Install

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIaO35mSC9Y/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <i class="tf-ion-social-instagram-outline"></i> Instagram Post
</a></p>

Approximately 1 week's work.

Similarly to the ceilings, everything has to be built in-situ, then removed, prepared and painted, then reinstalled.
The heater has to be mounted to a raised box in order for its exhaust to bypass sub-floor framing with adequate space. The exhaust can not touch anything because it gets very hot. Even the raised box is lightened by routing out unnecessary weight.
We installed a 15L fuel tank, which provides diesel to last a long time.
We also wrap nearby pipes with reflective heat insulation.
After the heater is installed, we build the wardrobe and microwave cabinet around it. All of which can be removed if the diesel heater ever has to be serviced.

<br>

#### Floor Coverings

We use a commercial-grade double-bonded underlay wool carpet.

###### Cab

<div>{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/cab-carpet_min.png" alt="Cab Carpet" class="" >}}<div><br>

###### House

The Floor is sealed with 2 coats of our shellac-based sealer. Then the underlay is glued down (glued floor and underlay), and then the carpet is glued down (glued underlay and carpet).

<div>{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/house-carpet_min.jpg" alt="House Carpet" class="" >}}<div><br><br>

#### More Preventative Rust Treatment

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIh1KHEplw2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

#### Another Master Piece

All electrical system components are exclusively Victron.

<div>{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/electrics-closet_min.jpg" alt="Victron Electrics Closet" class="" >}}<div><br><br>

#### Wet Room

The wetroom is another work of art.

###### Wetroom Sealed and Taped

All surfaces are sealed with 3 coats of epoxy sealer, then the sheet joins are fibreglass taped and coated with marine epoxy.

<div>{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/wetroom-sealed-taped_min.jpg" alt="Wetroom Sealed and Taped" class="" >}}<div><br>

###### Wetroom Sealed, Tanked, and Polyurethaned

Then tanked with 3 coats of marine epoxy.
The base is then coated with another 3 coats of epoxy brushing polyurethane, making the room completely waterproof.

<div>{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/wetroom-sealed-tanked-polyurethaned_min.jpg" alt="Wetroom Sealed Tanked Polyurethaned" class="" >}}<div><br>

###### Wetroom Cupboard Door Fabrication

This is the making of the wetroom cupboard door.

<div>{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/wetroom-cupboard-door-fabrication_min.jpg" alt="Wetroom Cupboard Door Fabrication" class="" >}}<div><br>

###### Tile-board Fabrication

We then create our own tile-board from 4mm okoume ply which receives 3 coats of our shellac-based sealer on the backs,

<div>{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/tile-board-coating_min.jpg" alt="Tile-board Coating" class="" >}}<div><br>

###### Tile-board Coating

About 6 coats of the same shellac-based sealer on the front and sanded between every coat until all wood-grain is filled.<br>
The tile board is cut and fitted, then removed, prepared, cured, and later fixed again.

<div>{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/tile-board-fabrication_min.jpg" alt="Tile-board Fabrication" class="" >}}<div><br>

The tile board then receives 3 coats of automotive lacquer.

###### Wetroom Fixing Linings

We then fix all linings and seal all joins.

<div>{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/wetroom-fixing-linings_min.jpg" alt="Wetroom Fixing Linings" class="" >}}<div><br>

###### Wetroom Finished

The result is an aesthetically stunning and completely waterproof room.

<div>{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/wetroom-finished_min.jpg" alt="Wetroom Finished" class="" >}}<div><br><br>

#### Side Entrance Door

Applying Grip Tread.

<div>{{< fingerprint-image src="/images/blog/2025/side-entrance-door_min.jpg" alt="Side Entrance Door" class="" >}}<div><br><br>


#### Build Time

16 Momths full time.
